## Steps for running the app and description:

The project uses Expo Go to build the app. My first preference was to use React Native CLI to work on the app, but encountered some issues with versioning of react-native-cli and because the project at my current workplace uses react-native-cli, didn't wanted to risk tampering it and lose the stable enviornment for my work project.

Please follow the steps below for building the app:
1. Have Expo envionment configured on the system.
2. Have XCode and iOS simulator installed on the system.
3. Clone the repo and run "npm i" in the root directory.
4. Run "npm run ios" script to run the app on the simulator.

This is a bsaic app as per the requirements specified. I actually wanted to include many more features into the app and make it like an actual app like "Netflix", but due to the time constraints such as my current 9-5 job and other commitments, couldn't do that. But I will continue to improve on this app in the coming days. 

Thanks!
